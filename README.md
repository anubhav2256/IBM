🚗 Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression — Project Description

This project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts the selling price of cars based on key features such as mileage, engine power, manufacturing year, fuel type, transmission, and more. The goal of this project is to develop a simple yet effective Linear Regression model that learns from historical car data and predicts accurate prices for used or new cars.

✅ Objective

Car prices depend on multiple factors, and manual estimation can be inaccurate. By using machine learning, we can identify patterns in historical data and forecast fair market prices.
This project demonstrates:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature encoding and scaling

Splitting dataset into training and testing sets

Training a Linear Regression model

Measuring accuracy with evaluation metrics

Making predictions on new data

✅ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data handling & preprocessing

Matplotlib/Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-Learn – Building the Linear Regression model

✅ Steps Covered

Data Collection: A dataset containing features like car name, year, km driven, fuel type, seller type, and transmission.

Data Cleaning: Removing missing values and converting categorical data into numerical form.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding correlations and visualizing trends like depreciation with age.

Model Training: Linear Regression is applied to learn the relationship between car features and price.

Evaluation: Model performance measured using R² Score, Mean Absolute Error, and Mean Squared Error.

Prediction: The trained model predicts the price for new car inputs.

✅ Result

The project delivers a trained machine learning model that can predict car prices with good accuracy. This model is helpful for:

Car resellers

Automotive businesses

Price comparison websites

Buyers looking for fair estimates

✅ Project Goals

✔ Understand regression concepts
✔ Build an end-to-end machine learning workflow
✔ Deploy or integrate into a web app in future
